### File sharing

If you are uploading shared resources for a specific course, you should put those in the respective sub-folder in the [`/resources`](https://github.com/bettermathematics/bettermathematics.github.io/tree/master/resources) folder. You can then make a link to the file that you just uploaded. See the [contribution guide](https://github.com/bettermathematics/bettermathematics.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-or-modifying-shared-resources) for more information.

If you are sharing anything that isn't really related to a specific course, or you feel does not belong on Better Mathematics, you can always upload it to the school-wide [SharePoint drive](https://uoe.sharepoint.com/sites/schoolofmaths/students/SitePages/Home.aspx).
