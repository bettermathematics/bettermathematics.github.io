**Short Summary:** 

*CORE COURSE for Honours Degrees involving Mathematics*. 

> Possibly one of the most iconic lecturers and courses the School of Maths has to offer

Main topics: analytic functions, holomorphic functions, Cauchy-Reimann equations, harmonic functions, Moebius transformations, the Reimann sphere, complex integration, series expansions, the residue calculus and its applications.

This course also has a "Skills" portion which involves mathematical reading and writing (i.e. $\LaTeX$), applicable to writing technical and non technical reports. Students will be required to complete a project researching a topic connected to complex numbers / complex analysis, producing a written report.
