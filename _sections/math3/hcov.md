title: Honours Complex Variables (MATH10068)
course-acronym: hcov
year: 3
---

This course has a "Skills" portion which involves mathematical reading and writing (i.e. \\(\LaTeX\\), applicable to writing technical and non technical reports. Students will be required to complete a project researching a topic connected to complex numbers / complex analysis, producing a written report.

**This is a core course for Honours degrees involving mathematics.**

**Main topics**: analytic functions, holomorphic functions, Cauchy-Reimann equations, harmonic functions, Moebius transformations, the Reimann sphere, complex integration, series expansions, the residue calculus and its applications.
