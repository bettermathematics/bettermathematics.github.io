title: Linear Programming, Modelling, and Solution
course-acronym: lpms
year: 3
---

Linear programming (LP) is the fundamental modelling technique in optimal decision-making. This course will introduce the concepts of LP modelling, explore the mathematical properties of general LP problems and study the theory of the simplex algorithm as a solution technique. Theoretical understanding / hand calculation will be assessed via the written examination.

Students will learn to use the Xpress mathematical programming system to create, solve and analyse case studies, then present their work in oral and written form: via a short individual Xpress assignment and a substantial group-based case study.
