title: Honours Analysis (MATH10068)
course-acronym: hana
year: 3
---

This course builds on ideas studied in the analysis portion of [Fundamentals of Pure Mathematics (MATH08064)](/math2/#fundamentals-of-pure-mathematics). The course introduces uniform convergence and the Reimann integral, and leads onto the abstract concept of a metric space.  Finally we look at some applications to solving equations via the fixed-point method, and at the rudiments of Fourier series.

This course also has a "Skills" portion which involves practising explaining mathematics, consider "metacognitive skills" (i.e. stepping back from a problem and consider how the approach is developing), and illustrating your own and others' mathematical ideas.

**This is a core course for Honours degrees involving mathematics.**

**Main topics**: FPM Analysis revision, Cauchy sequences, Bolzano Weierstrass theorem, Uniform convergence of sequences and series of functions, power series, The Reimann integral, uniform convergence, the fundamental theorem of calculus,  metric spaces, point set topology, Heine-Borel theorem, Banach contradiction mapping theorem & applications, Fourier series.
