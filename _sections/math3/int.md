The main theme of this course is the interplay between number theory and rings.

**Main topics**: Binary operations on integers, axioms of a ring, the ring of integers \\(\mathbb{Z}\\) (primes, units and irreducibles), division algorithm, Euclidean Algorithm, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, using rings to prove basic results from elementary number theory, integral domains, zero divisors, greatest common divisors, gaussian integers and rings \\(\mathbb{Z}[d]\\) where \\(d\\) is some irrational number, units, primes and irreducibles in rings, special focus connections of Gaussian integers and quadratic residues and the Legendre symbol
