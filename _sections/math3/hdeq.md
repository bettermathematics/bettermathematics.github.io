This course has a "Skills" portion which involves programming in Python, in particular using SciPy ODE solvers. Activities include: plotting phase portraits of 1st order ODEs, exploring dynamical non-linear systems, implementing numerical methods (Euler, Heun, etc), Fourier coefficient computation, plots of 2D functions and animations of PDEs.

**This is a core course for Honours degrees involving mathematics.**

**Main topics**: higher order linear equations, Laplace transforms, systems of First Order Linear ODEs, numerical methods, non-linear systems of ODEs, non-linear methods (eg. Lyapunov functions), Fourier Series, use of separation of variables in standard PDEs, Sturm-Liouville Theory.
