---

This course explores reliable and computationally efficient numerical techniques for practical linear algebra problems. Traditional linear algebra techniques are usually too computationally intensive to be used for the large matrices encountered in practical applications. Such algorithms will be studied, analysed (and assessed) theoretically, as well as implemented using an advanced programming language (MATLAB? Python?). This course includes significant lab work.

**Main topics**: solution of linear systems of equations, the solution of least squares problems, finding the eigenvectors and/or eigenvalues of a matrux
