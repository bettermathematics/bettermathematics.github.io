A great introductory course on how to get useful information from data. Particularly useful if you are interested in statistics and/or want to acquire some basic computing skills (the `R` programming language is used in this course). You will also learn how to use git (and GitHub) -- so that you can actively contribute to BetterMathematics! 👩‍💻

The resources are very well prepared and are all available on the [course website](https://introds.org/) and the [course repository](https://github.com/ids-s1-20). Oh and it's coursework only! The coursework has individual (60%) and team (40%) components.

No statistical or computing background is required as a pre-requisite.
