- <sup id="note-1">[1]</sup>: <small>Some courses may have a separate course webpage where you will find teaching material.</small>
- <sup id="note-2">[2]</sup>: <small>Creating a timetable for yourself on PATH does not finalize what your timetable will be – it simply allows you to come up with a rough idea for what you would like your schedule to look like. You must still meet with your personal tutor to officially enrol you on these courses.</small>
- <sup id="note-3">[3]</sup>: <small>Please make sure you're looking at the DPT for the correct year! You can change the year in the URL, e.g. `20-21`</small>.

#### Library and study spaces

The library service in the upcoming year is likely to be restricted – check [Library Services Update](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/library-museum-gallery/library-services-update-2020-21) for more details. Library resources can also be accessed online via [DiscoverEd](https://discovered.ed.ac.uk/).
