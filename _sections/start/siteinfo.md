title: 8. Site Information
---

- This platform drew inspiration from [Better Informatics](https://betterinformatics.com/) and greatly relied on its source code. It is a project aiming to achieve the same goals, but within the School of Informatics. Without the maintainers and contributors of Better Informatics, none of this would be possible, so we would like to give them a big thanks. The initial development of Better Mathematics was also kindly sponsored as part of the ASID project in the School of Mathematics.
- This site is student authored and maintained, volunteer student contributors are what brings it value.
- Guidelines for contributing to Better Mathematics can be found on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bettermathematics/bettermathematics.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- An simple outline of the site and its structure be [downloaded](resources/general/site-info/BetterMaths-Brief-Explainer.odt).
