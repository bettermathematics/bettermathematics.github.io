#### \\(\LaTeX\\)

\\(\LaTeX\\) is a mathematical typesetting language that is commonly used for producing documents containing mathematical elements (formulae, diagrams, matrices etc.). It will be an invaluable tool, especially later on in your degree when you write things like dissertations or reports, so it's best if you start learning it early!

#### `R`

`R` is a perhaps the most well-known statistical programming language. It offers many features and packages that allow you to carry out detailed statistical analyses and produce high-quality reports and visualizations. It is used in most of the practical statistics courses offered by the school.

To get started with `R`, you will need to download two things:

- `R`, the progamming language itself -- you can download this from the [R Project website](https://www.r-project.org/).
- `RStudio`, an integrated development environment (IDE) where you will write and execute your `R` programs. You can download this from the [RStudio website](https://rstudio.com/).

Make sure that the versions of `R` and `RStudio` that you install are compatible with each other!

#### Git / GitHub
