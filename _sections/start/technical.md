#### \\(\LaTeX\\)

\\(\LaTeX\\) is a mathematical typesetting language that is commonly used for producing documents containing mathematical elements (formulae, diagrams, matrices etc.). It will be an invaluable tool, especially later on in your degree when you write things like dissertations or reports, so it's best if you start learning it early!

- Editors:
	- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) (online editor): through the university you get a [professional account](https://www.overleaf.com/edu/edinburgh) which allows you to share documents and work together on documents with other people
	- [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) (macOS)
	- [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/) (Windows)
	- [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (Linux)

#### `R`

`R` is a perhaps the most well-known statistical programming language. It offers many features and packages that allow you to carry out detailed statistical analyses and produce high-quality reports and visualizations. It is used in most of the practical statistics courses offered by the school.

To get started with `R`, you will need to download two things:

- `R`, the progamming language itself -- you can download this from the [R Project website](https://www.r-project.org/).
- `RStudio`, an integrated development environment (IDE) where you will write and execute your `R` programs. You can download this from the [RStudio website](https://rstudio.com/).

Make sure that the versions of `R` and `RStudio` that you install are compatible with each other!

#### Git / GitHub

Git is a system that allows you to keep better track of different versions of your code. It is not necessary for most mathematics courses, but is a useful way of backing up your code. Through GitHub, you can also showcase any interesting projects to potential employers!

Git and GitHub are extre useful when you are working on large group projects with people collaborating on different parts of code.

To get started, read [this introduction blog post by HubSpot](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners).

Also, Better Mathematics runs on a service offered by GitHub, called GitHub pages. While you don't need to know much about Git and GitHub to contribute to the website, knowledge of these tools will help if you want to add any cool features.
