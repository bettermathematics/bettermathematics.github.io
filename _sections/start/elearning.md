This year, the university experience is likely to be different to previous years. The [**Virtual Social Handbook**](resources/general/virtual-social-handbook-v3.pdf) will provide you with some useful information from students regarding this change. There's also some [guidance from the University](https://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-academic-development/study-hub/learning-resources/hybrid-learning-and-teaching).

- [Tech & equipment needed](https://teaching.maths.ed.ac.uk/main/undergraduate/studies/equipment) for studying in the School of Mathematics -- you can [borrow a laptop](https://backend.maths.ed.ac.uk/maths-services/student_laptops/uoe-laptops.php) directly from the School, or use the [University Laptop Loan Service](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/library-museum-gallery/using-library/borrowing-a-book/borrowing-laptops)
- [Office365](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/comms-and-collab/office365): Mail, Calendar, OneDrive, Teams, OneNote, SharePoint, Skype for Business etc.
- [University VPN service](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/desktop-personal/vpn) <details> Depending on where you are, you might not have access to all the online platforms you will need for online teaching. If you find this to be the case, the university offers a VPN service through which you can connect your own device from your current location to the university network and can use the internet as if you are in Edinburgh. The VPN service also allows you access to any files you might have stored on a university computer in the last year that you might want to access during the upcoming year.
